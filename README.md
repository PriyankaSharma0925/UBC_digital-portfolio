# My Data Science Portfolio

This repository contains my portfolio created as part of course Key Capabilities in data science, created using Jupyter Notebooks and Markdown files. It showcases my learning journey, projects, analyses in a structured and interactive format.

## Overview

- **Portfolio Creation:**  
  I learned how to use Jupyter Notebooks effectively to document my data science projects and analyses. The notebooks combine code, visualizations, and rich text to tell the story behind the data.

- **Site Structure:**  
  The portfolio is organized with Markdown files such as `about_me.md`, `cv.md`, and `citations.md` to provide context and background. Supporting files like `_config.yml` and `_toc.yml` are used to configure the siteâ€™s structure and navigation.

- **Deployment:**  
  I deployed this portfolio as a static site hosted on GitHub Pages, enabling easy sharing and online accessibility.
